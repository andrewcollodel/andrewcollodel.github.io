# Machine_Learning_Portfolio

 Machine Learning Portfolio  This repository contains various machine learning models that have been build on public datasets. Most datasets are soured from Kaggle.com.    
 
 This is a leaning environment, and the notebooks are detailed with descriptions and explanations (mostly for me).  
   
 This also acts as a repository of various templates and how to approach or tackle different machine learning challenges.
