										<h2>Using Ordinary Least Squares Regression to predict predict housing prices</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This project uses a randomly generated dataset to build a linear regression model that predicts housing prices<br>
									The purpose of this project is to predict housing based on area income, house age, average number of bedrooms, average number of rooms and area population.<br>
									Conclusion: How good is this model? The metric indicate that this is a less than perfect model. The bedroom variable adds little value to the model. The best approach to evaluate this model would be to construct a second model with different predictor variables. Unfortunately this data set does not contain any other useful variables.</p>

												<h3>Classifying Data with Logistic Regression in Python</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The purpose of this project is to predict if a borrower will default on their loan. The predictors are annual income and credit score, and the response is loan default.<br>
											Loan Approval Classification Dataset source information Synthetic Data for binary classification on Loan Approval<br>
											The dataset contains 45,000 records and 14 fields<br>
											Observations regarding this dataset, as cited from the source on GitHub: "This dataset is a synthetic version inspired by the original Credit Risk dataset on Kaggle and enriched with additional variables based on Financial Risk for Loan Approval data. SMOTENC was employed to simulate new data points, thereby enlarging the instances."<br>
											Conclusion: The first row of the matrix indicates that, out of 10,498 instances, the model correctly predicted 9,778 as Yes but incorrectly classified 720 as Yes when they should have been No. The second row of the matrix reveals that, out of 3,000 instances, the model accurately predicted 1,685 as No but incorrectly classified 1,315 as false negatives.</p>

												<h3>NYC Bridge Crossings - Poisson regression model</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This project was developed to facilitate the learning of Poisson regression. The Poisson regression model is used to analyse the bicyclist counts observed on the Brooklyn Bridge between April 1, 2017, and October 31, 2017.<br>
											The project begins with the Poisson regression model, utilizing it as the "control" for the Negative Binomial regression model in the second part of the project. Cameron and Trivedi (2013) recommend the best practice of estimating both Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models. This project is further continued in Project 4, where the Negative Binomial regression model is developed<br>
											Conclusion: The model appears to be tracking the trend in the actual counts. However, a significant number of the predictions are inaccurate when compared to the actual values.</p>

												<h3> Classifying Exam Results with Logistic Regression in Python</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The objective of this project is to predict whether a student will pass their exams, based on an average pass rate of 60% (60% and above = pass; below 60% = fail), which is the minimum requirement at prestigious universities. <br>
											The predictors include gender, ethnicity, preparation, lunch, and parents' education. The response variable is the Year Result (pass or fail). <br>
											The dataset comprises 1,000 records and 8 fields.<br>
											Conclusion: The first row of the matrix indicates that, out of 300 instances, the model correctly predicted 22 as Yes but incorrectly classified 64 as Yes when they should have been No. The second row of the matrix shows that, out of 300 instances, the model accurately predicted 200 as No but incorrectly classified 14 as false negatives<br>
											Correct predictions: 200 + 22 = 222 (74% of predictions correct).<br>
											Incorrect predictions: 64 + 14 = 78 (26% of predictions incorrect).<br>
											Total predictions: 300</p>

												<h3> Using Polynomial Regression to predict Co2 emissions based on city mpg</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This project uses a historical dataset to build a linear regression model that predicts Co2 emissions based on city mpg.<br>
												Test Results:<br>
												Test 1: Medium, 14 mpg city - Predicted value: 562.75, underreporting by 1.33%.<br>
												Test 2: High, 40 mpg city - Predicted value: 193.64, underreporting by 11.55%.<br>
												Test 3: Low, 7 mpg city - Predicted value: 1006.78, underreporting by 8.95%.<br>
												Statistical Analysis:<br>
												•	Mean Squared Error: 618.79<br>
												•	R-squared: 0.96 (96%)<br>
												The model has shown improvement; however, it may still lack sufficient predictor variables.</p>
