										<h1>About me</h1>

									<p>My career has been a fascinating and unique journey starting out as a construction plant mechanic, land surveyor, construction, farming, disaster management and now studying data science. </p>
									<p>I have a keen awareness of how valuable data is when it is turned into information that inform management decisions. I have literally seen how having the right information at the right time in the right way save lives.</p>
									<p>I am an efficient and skilled information analyst with over twenty years of experience in research and data analytics. My unique skill set integrates technical programming, statistical and academic research, and subject matter expertise in social work and business. I have advanced knowledge of DAX, M-Code (Power Query), Python, and a good understanding of SQL. I am proficient in Power BI, Power Query, and Office (ECDL Certified), and experienced in working with large databases, including data warehouses.</p>
									<p>Over the past thirty years I have travelled around the globe to over fifty countries responding to disasters and working with people in need. When working within the local authority where I live, I can use my experience to understand and solve complex data problems. </p>
									<p>Whether it is after the floods in Mozambique, or Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Yolanda or the earthquake in Napal or the war in Gaza (2014) I have firsthand experience how converting data into information can save lives and bring urgent relief to people when the need it the most. </p>
									<p>My passion is working with Adult Social Care teams to streamline their workflows, track progress and ensure that no case is left unattended for long. Recent developments include Provider Portal Diagnostics Report that monitors care provider visit uploads against contracted visits identifying divergence, or the Support Plan Diagnostic Report that preforms over twenty quality assurance checks on the Support Plan before it is finalised and processed or payment or the automated Adult Social Care User Survey tool that extracts and samples the eligible population in a matter of seconds, going room 6 weeks to 6 seconds.</p>
									<p>I am a qualified Construction Plant Mechanic, Land Surveyor, an experienced farmer and builder including building two Corn Soya Blend food factories in Mozambique and Angola to produce fortified foods for school lunch programs which ed over half a million school children. I hold a Master's degree in Development Studies, a Bachelor (Honours) degree in Development Studies, and a Bachelor's degree in Human & Social Studies, specializing in Community Development with a major in Social Work. I recently successfully completed the L4 Data Analysist apprenticeship and am currently studying a L6 Data Scientist integrated degree apprenticeship at BPP University.</p>
									<p>I have contributed to several notable publications, particularly in the field of humanitarian aid and development:</p>
									<p>"The Failure of Cross-country Regression Analysis in Measuring the Impact of Foreign Aid": Co-authored with Derica Alba Kotz√©, this article critiques the effectiveness of cross-country regression analysis in evaluating foreign aid's impact. It was published in the Journal of Developing Societies</p>
									<p>"Food Security and Livelihoods Interventions for Older People in Emergencies": This publication, produced by HelpAge International, provides comprehensive guidelines on addressing food security and livelihoods for older people during emergencies</p>
