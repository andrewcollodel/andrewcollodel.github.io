										<h2>Data Science</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I am deeply committed to collaborating with Adult Social Care teams to optimize their workflows, monitor progress, and ensure timely attention to all cases. Recent initiatives include the development of the Provider Portal Diagnostics Report, which tracks care provider visit uploads against contracted visits to identify discrepancies. Additionally, I have introduced the Support Plan Diagnostic Report, which performs over twenty quality assurance checks on support plans before they are finalized and processed for payment. Furthermore, I have implemented an automated Adult Social Care User Survey tool that efficiently extracts and samples the eligible population in mere seconds, reducing the process time from six weeks to just six seconds.</p>

I have witnessed how transforming data into actionable information can save lives and provide urgent relief to those in dire need.</p>

									<p>I am a qualified Construction Plant Mechanic and Land Surveyor, as well as an experienced farmer and builder. My achievements include constructing two Corn Soya Blend food factories in Mozambique and Angola, which produce fortified foods for school lunch programs, benefiting over half a million school children. I hold a Master’s degree in Development Studies, a Bachelor (Honours) degree in Development Studies, and a Bachelor’s degree in Human & Social Studies, specializing in Community Development with a major in Social Work. Recently, I successfully completed the Level 4 Data Analyst apprenticeship and am currently pursuing a Level 6 Data Scientist integrated degree apprenticeship at BPP University.</p>
